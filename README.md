# Odin Flight Booker

## Demo
![Flightbooker]

Created a one-way flight booker with the typical airline blooking flow:

* Enter desired dates / airports and click "Search"

* Choose from among a list of available flights

* Enter passenger information for all passengers

## DISCLAIMER
* This app only works for certain dates and certain flights because of how I seeded the database
* Working flights are SFO to NYC , BOS to HNL, HNL to LAX
* Working dates respectively are, Nov 9, Nov 10, Nov 10, Nov 10

## Things I would add
* When I come back to this project I would like to add proper formatting of views with css
* Refactor code for better readability 
* Refactor code for seeding the database better

## Things I learned 
* Nested forms 
* Database seeding
* Select boxes 
* Faker gem
* More practice on associations, forms, params

## Challenges
* Had trouble figuring out what kind of associations each model should have. 
* Had trouble seeding the database properly 
* Had trouble with hash params
